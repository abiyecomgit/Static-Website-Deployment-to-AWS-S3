# Click Create bucket.

Set the following values:

. Bucket name: my-bucket- with the AWS account ID or another series of numbers at the end to make it globally unique

Ensure all four permissions restrictions beneath it are also un-checked.
Check the box to acknowledge that turning off all public access might result in the bucket and its objects becoming public.
